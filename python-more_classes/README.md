# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project contains Python programs that explore advanced object-oriented programming concepts, focusing on classes, objects, attributes, methods, and data abstraction.

## General Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- "First-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- What are the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and how to use them
- What is the difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`
- What is a class attribute
- What is the difference between an object attribute and a class attribute
- What is a class method
- What is a static method
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is and what does contain `__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-rectangle.py` | Empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle |
| `1-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with width and height private attributes |
| `2-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with area and perimeter methods |
| `3-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with string representation |
| `4-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with repr method for eval() |
| `5-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with deletion message |
| `6-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with instance counter |
| `7-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with customizable print symbol |
| `8-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with static method to compare rectangles |
| `9-rectangle.py` | Rectangle class with class method to create squares |

## Usage

Each Python file contains a class definition and can be tested with the corresponding main file:

```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
./2-main.py
# ... and so on
```
