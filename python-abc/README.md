# Python - Abstract Base Classes (ABC)

This project explores the concept of Abstract Base Classes (ABC) in Python, including abstract methods, duck typing, multiple inheritance, and mixins.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is an Abstract Base Class (ABC)
- How to use the `abc` module in Python
- What are abstract methods and how to implement them
- What is duck typing and how it works in Python
- How to extend built-in Python classes
- What is multiple inheritance and method resolution order (MRO)
- What are mixins and how to use them effectively

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

0. **Abstract Animal Class and its Subclasses** - Create an abstract Animal class with abstract method `sound`, and implement Dog and Cat subclasses
1. **Shapes, Interfaces, and Duck Typing** - Create abstract Shape class with Circle and Rectangle implementations using duck typing
2. **Extending the Python List with Notifications** - Create VerboseList that extends list with notification messages
3. **CountedIterator - Keeping Track of Iteration** - Create an iterator that counts items as they are iterated
4. **The Enigmatic FlyingFish - Exploring Multiple Inheritance** - Implement multiple inheritance with Fish and Bird classes
5. **The Mystical Dragon - Mastering Mixins** - Use mixin classes to compose Dragon behavior
